Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information
computer vision is like giving computers the ability to see and understand the world like humans do. This means that computers can now identify objects, track their movement, and even recognize complex patterns in images and videos

Image filtering
image filtering is the process of modifying an image its shades or color of pixels. it is also used to increase brightness and contrest 

cv.split:is used to split a multi-channel image into its individual color channels
cv.merge:is used to merge individual color channels into a multi-channel image
cv.resize:is used to resize images

Draw geometric shapes on image
In OpenCV, you can draw various geometric shapes on an image using functions like cv2.line(), cv2.rectangle(), cv2.circle(), cv2.putText(), cv2.ellipse()

Bind Track Bars
Track bars are a powerful tool in OpenCV for creating interactive applications where users can dynamically adjust parameters and visualize the results in real-time

Object Detection using HSV Color Space in OpenCV
Object detection using HSV color space is a technique used in computer vision to identify and locate objects based on their color information. t's a color representation model that separates the color information from the lightness information, making it easier to perform color-based analysis

Hue: Represents the color itself (e.g., red, green, blue).
Saturation: Represents the purity of the color (e.g., intense vs. washed out).
Value: Represents the brightness of the color (e.g., light vs. dark)

Simple Image Thresholding
Image thresholding is a basic technique in image processing used to segment an image into regions based on intensity values. Simple Image Thresholding involves converting an image into a binary image (black and white) by setting a threshold value. Pixels with intensities below the threshold are set to one value (usually 0 or black), and pixels with intensities above the threshold are set to another value (usually 255 or white).

Adaptive thresholding
Adaptive thresholding is a technique in image processing where the threshold value is not a fixed constant, but it varies across different regions of the image based on local characteristics. This is particularly useful when the illumination conditions vary across the image

Matplotlib with OpenCV
Combining Matplotlib with OpenCV is a powerful approach for visualizing and analyzing images in Python. Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library, and when used with OpenCV, it allows you to display, compare, and analyze images easily.

2. Displaying Multiple Images Side by Side:
4. Handling Matplotlib Events for Interactive Visualization:

Morphological Transformations
Morphological transformations are operations based on the shape of an image. These operations are typically used for preprocessing in image analysis and computer vision tasks. The two primary morphological operations are Erosion and Dilation
1. Erosion:Dilation is a morphological operation that enhances the brighter regions in an image
2. Dilation:Erosion is a morphological operation that diminishes the brighter regions in an image
3. Opening: Opening is a combination of an erosion operation followed by a dilation operation.
4. Closing:Closing is a combination of a dilation operation followed by an erosion operation.
