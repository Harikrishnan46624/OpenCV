Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them
computer vision is like giving computers the ability to see and understand the world like humans do. This means that computers can now identify objects, track their movement, and even recognize complex patterns in images and videos

Self-driving cars
Medical imaging analysis
Facial recognition
Object detection and tracking
Image and video classification

Image filtering
image filtering is the process of modifying an image its shades or color of pixels. it is also used to increase brightness and contrest 

IMAGE THRESHOLD
the threshold is converted everything to white or black based on the threshold value

Image Gradient
An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or colour in an image
